## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Sign Up on the Cisco Website
- Create an account on the [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/).
- This account is required to access the Cisco Packet Tracer course and download the installer.

### Step 2: Enroll in the Cisco Packet Tracer Course
- Enroll in the **Cisco Packet Tracer** course available on the Networking Academy platform.

### Step 3: Download the Packet Tracer Installer
- Navigate to the course page and locate the **Download Packet Tracer** link.
- Download the Ubuntu-compatible `.deb` installer package to your system (default location: `~/Downloads`).

### Step 4: Verify the Installer Package

### Step 5: Attempt Installation
- Run the following command to install the Packet Tracer package:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/Packet_Tracer822_amd64_signed.deb
```

### Step 6: Update Ubuntu Package Lists
Update your systemâ€™s package lists to ensure all packages are up-to-date:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
This command ensures Ubuntu can fetch the latest package information from the repositories.


### Step 7: Check for Missing Dependencies
If the installation fails, identify missing dependencies. For example:
To check for libgl1-mesa-glx, run:
```bash
apt-cache search libgl1-mesa-glx
```

### Interpret the results:
No results returned: The package is unavailable in your current repositories.
Result includes:
libgl1-mesa-glx - transitional dummy package
This means the package is available, and you can proceed.

### Step 8: Install Required Dependencies
If dependencies such as libxcb-xinerama0-dev are missing, install them using:
```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-xinerama0-dev
```
This command installs the required library, resolving the missing dependency issue.

### Step 9: Final Installation
Re-run the installation command for Cisco Packet Tracer:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/Packet_Tracer822_amd64_signed.deb
```
This step completes the installation process, ensuring all required dependencies are resolved.

### Post-Installation
Launch Cisco Packet Tracer by searching for it in your applications menu or using the following command in the terminal:
packettracer

### Troubleshooting
If additional errors occur during installation, check the missing dependencies and install them using:
```bash
sudo apt install <dependency-name>
```

Repeat the installation process until all dependencies are resolved.
